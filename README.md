# Object-Detection-with-SSD
This is my first project with object detection using SSD, with references to the implementation of SSD from [amdegroot](https://github.com/amdegroot/ssd.pytorch/commits?author=amdegroot) and [huutrinh68](https://github.com/huutrinh68/dl-pytorch) with minor adjustment. SSD is an old object detection algorithm, realeased in 2016, but it still cover a lot of useful ideas of how an object detection algorithm may works.
